The engineers at EpicONE Games are determining the cache memory and node provisioning size for their AWS ElastiCache cluster to support high throughput, low latency, and approximately 35 to 45 million users per session for their upcoming war game. They have been advised to distribute the memory over more nodes with smaller capacities rather than using fewer nodes with larger capacities. With a requirement of 35 GB of cache memory for the cluster, one of the engineers has proposed several options. How would you assist the team in choosing the correct sizing from the proposed options?
A)	
The number of nodes in the cluster is not a key factor when it comes to cluster availability.
B)	
Use cache.t2.medium type of nodes with each having 3.22 GiB memory, 2 cores, and a quantity of 11 nodes giving 35.42 GiB in total meeting the requirement.
C)	
Start with one cache.m5.large node. Monitor memory usage, CPU utilization, and cache hit rate with ElastiCache metrics that further get published to CloudWatch. These metrics will enable monitoring of your clusters in the form CPU usage and cache gets and cache misses. These metrics will get measured and published for each Cache node in 60-second intervals. Based on the results, node and memory sizing can then be worked upon.
D)	
The node size does not impact the performance and fault tolerance at all. You could start with the t2 type of instances keeping the cost to a minimum and then add the nodes as the requirement increases.

You have a launch template where a subnet is specified in its network interface. Now you need to use AWS CLI (aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group) to create an Auto Scaling group with the launch template.

A)	
Create another launch template with the new subnet in its network interface. In AWS CLI (aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group), specify the same subnet through the --vpc-zone-identifier option.
B)	
Modify the subnet in the launch template and create the ASG using the latest version of the launch template.
C)	
Change the subnet in the launch template. In AWS CLI (aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group), specify the subnet through the --launch-template option.
D)	
Specify the subnet through the --vpc-zone-identifier option in AWS CLI (aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group). The subnet in the launch template is ignored.
