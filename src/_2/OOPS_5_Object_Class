What is java.lang.object?
    Inheritance looks kind of interesting,but when would we really use it?
    Well,it turns out,in java,we've been using inheritance all along.
    This is because every class you create in java,intrinsically extends a special java class.
    This class is named Object,and it's in the java.lang package.
    Ok that's confusing,a class called Object?
    Let's see what java has to say about this class.
    We'll use the link to Java's Application Programming Interface(API) for this class,which you can find in resource section

    Class Object is the root of the class hierarchy.Every class has Object as a superclass.All objects,including arrays,
    implement the methods of this class.Whether we knew it or not,your classes were extending this class,Object.
    They all inherit from Object.And what that means is,all of your classes,have functionality built in that you can use or
    override,the minute you create them.
    Every Class inherits from Object
                                                   Object
                                                    clone():Object
                                                    equals(obj:Object):boolean
                                                    hashCode():int
                                                    toString():String
                    Main                                                    String
              -------------------      This shows that our Main            ------------------------
              static main              class inherits from,or is a         charAt(int,index):char
                                       subclass of Object,as also is       ...
                                       is String.                          equals(obj:Object):boolean
                                       The String class has over 60        ...
                                       methods                             toString():String
                                       The String class overrides          ...
                                       several methods on Object,two       static valueOf(Object obj):String
                                       of which are equals(),and toString.
