String vs StringBuilder
    Since String is immutable,each method call returns a new instance of a String.
    As an alternative Java provides a mutable class that lets us change its text value.This is the StringBuilder class.

Creating Instances
    Instantiating String Objects                                Instantiating StringBuilder Objects
    String hello = "Hello";                         StringBuilder helloBuilder  = new StringBuilder("Hello");
    String helloworld = "Hello"+"World";            StringBuilder emptyBuilder  = new StringBuilder();
    String badHello = new String("Hello");          StringBuilder emptyBuilder5 = new StringBuilder(5);
    //valid code but redundant                      StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(helloBuilder);

    There are four ways to create a new StringBuilder Object,using the new keyword.
        Pass a String.
        Pass no arguments at all.
        Pass an integer value.
        Pass some other type of character sequence(like StringBuilder).
String methods vs StringBuilder methods
    String methods create a new object in memory,and return a reference to this new object.
    StringBuilder methods return a StringBuilder reference,but it's really a self-reference.
    Unlike strings,we can call methods on StringBuilders without the need to assign the results,to an intermediate variables
    as we saw with strings.
    StringBuilder methods return this self-reference,to support chaining methods together.

some methods unique to StringBuilder class
A String Builder class has many similar methods to Strings
But it also has methods to remove and insert characters or Strings,and truncate it's size.
method                        description
delete                        You can delete a substring using indices to specify a range,or delete a single character at an index.
deleteCharAt
insert                        You can insert text at a specified position.
reverse                       You can reverse the order of the characters in the sequence.
setLength                     setLength can be used to truncate the sequence,or include null sequences to fill out the sequence
                              to that length.
