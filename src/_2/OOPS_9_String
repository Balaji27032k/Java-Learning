The String
The String has over 60 methods available.
The String is a sequence of characters,meaning its characters are ordered and indexed.
The index starts at 0,and not 1.
let's take String -> "Hello World"
The length of the string is 11,but its last index is 10.

The purpose of String methods
    we can split String's methods up into three basic categories:
        String Inspection Methods -> These provides some information about the string.lenght(),isEmpty() and etc.
        Methods for Comparing String Values. -> These usually return a boolean value(String values equal or not).
        String Manipulation Methods. -> Transform one string value to another.

String inspection Methods
method                                                      description
length                          Returns the number of characters in the String
charAt                          Returns the character at the index that's passed
indexOf                         Returns an integer, representing the index in the sequence where the String or character
lastIndexOf                     passed, can be located in the String.
isEmpty                         Returns true if length is 0.
isBlank                         Returns true if length is zero OR the string only contains whitespace characters,add in jdk11

String Comparison Methods
method                                                      description
contentEquals                   Returns a boolean if the String's value is equal to the value of the argument passed.
                                This method allows for arguments other than String,for any type that is a character
                                sequence.
Equals                          Return a boolean if the String's value is equal to the value fo the argument passed.
equalsIgnoreCase                Return a boolean if the String's value is equal(ignoring case),to the value of the argument
                                passed.
contains                        Returns a boolean if the String contains the arguments passed.
endsWith                        These return a boolean,and are much like the contains method,but more specific to the
startsWith                      placement of the argument in the String.
regionMatches                   Returns a boolean,if defined sub-regions are matched.

String Manipulation Methods
We've split into two groups
The first set of methods,don't actually change the underlying meaning of the text value,but perform some kind of clean up.
method                                                      description
indent                          This method was added in jdk 15,and adds or removes spaces from the beginning of lines in multi
                                line text.
strip                           The difference between the strip method and trim method is that the strip() supports a larger
stripLeading                    set of white space characters.It and the corresponding stripLeading and stripTrailing methods
stripTrailing                   were added in jdk 11.
trim

toLowerCase                     Returns a new String,either in a lower case or in upper case.
toUpperCase

The second set of string manipulation methods,transform the String value and return a string with a different meaning than the
original String.
method                                                      description
concat                          Similar to the plus operator for strings,it concatenates text to the String and returns a new
                                String as a result.
join                            Allows multiple strings to be concatenated together in a single method,specifying a delimiter.
repeat                          Returns the String repeated by the number of times specified in the argument.
replace                         These methods replace characters or strings in the string,returning a new String with replacements
replaceAll                      made.
replaceFirst

substring                       These return a part of the String,its range defined by the start and end index specified.
subSequence
