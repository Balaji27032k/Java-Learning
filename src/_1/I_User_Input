The Scanner Class
The scanner class is described as a simple text scanner,which can parse primitive types and strings.
To use the scanner class,we have to create an instance of Scanner.This means we're creating an object of type Scanner.We'll use
new keyword for that.
The new Keyword
The new keyword is used in what java calls a class Instance Creation Expression.
In it's simplest form ,it's the word new ,followed by the class name,and empty parenthesis.
ClassName variableName = new ClassName();
We can optionally pass arguments in those parenthesis,as we saw with methods.
ClassName variableName = new ClassName(argument1,argument2);
we saw that we could do this with the String class,passing the text in the parenthesis.
Instantiating Scanner
For reading input from the console or terminal,we instantiate a scanner object using new,followed by the Scanner class name,
and passing System.in,as an argument,in the parenthesis.
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
For reading input from a file,we instantiate a scanner object using new,again with the Scanner class name,but pass a File Object,
as an argument ,in the parenthesis.
    File is another class provided by Java,for reading and writing files.
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("nameOfFileOnFileSystem"));
